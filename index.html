                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                    Thom Bee (he/him) is a creative, alternative comedian based in Manchester, England. With a friendly, laid back, and conversational style, Thom does his best to skewer nostalgia whilst covering some heavier topics in a disarming and charming way.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                    Performing comedy for six years, Thom has spent the majority of his time working in the double act (No) Money in the Bank with fellow weirdo and 90s enthusiast, Andrew Marsh. Together they've produced three shows, two regular nights, a podcast, and a plethora of material that has seeped into both performer's solo work. Thom's solo comedy is a combination of this irreverence, but with the addition of stories about his own struggles with mental health, alcholism, and his many other failings (but in a funny way...obviously.)
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                    Currently working on his debut hour, Psychocinematic, Thom is keen to work with a variety of new comedy clubs, performers, and events to cut his teeth as sharp as possible. Please book this giddy but misanthropic lovely boy.
